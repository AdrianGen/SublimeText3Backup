# SublimeText3Backup
First backup.

You just need to backup your User folder (that's what I'm doing here2.9k)

All your global settings, keybindings, packages settings etc are saved in it.

An interesting package settings the package control's one. There is the list of all the plugins that are installed.

Say you want to use your config on an other computer, here's what you have to do:

- remove the User folder of the fresh install
- clone your backup (only the User folder)
- install Package Control
- restart Sublime Text
- Done.
